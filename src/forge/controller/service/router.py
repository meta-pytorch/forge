class Batcher:
    """
    Asynchronous batching wrapper around a Router.

    Instead of selecting a replica immediately, incoming requests are enqueued
    and grouped into batches. Once a batch is ready (either reaching the maximum
    size or exceeding the maximum wait time), the batcher makes a single routing
    decision using the inner router. All requests in that batch are then resolved
    with the same replica.

    This reduces router overhead by amortizing multiple requests into one decision.

    Args:
        inner_router: The underlying Router used to pick a replica.
        get_healthy_replicas: Callable that returns the current list of healthy replicas.
        get_session_map: Callable that returns the session-to-replica mapping.
        batch_size: Maximum number of requests to collect in a single batch
                        before routing (default: 8).
        batch_timeout: Maximum time to wait (in seconds) before routing a batch,
                          even if batch_size is not reached (default: 0.01).

    Example:
        rr_router = RoundRobinRouter()
        batcher = Batcher(
            rr_router,
            get_healthy_replicas=service._get_healthy_replicas,
            get_session_map=service._get_session_map,
